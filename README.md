<h3><b>Projects</b></h3>
<h4><b>Current</b></h4>

- [C Collection](https://github.com/KieraConway/C-Collection)<br>
  - Language: `C`
  - A collection of my smaller, standalone C projects that do not warrant individual repositories.

- [Language Syntax](https://github.com/KieraConway/LanguageSyntax)<br>
  - Language: `Assembly`, `C`, `CLI`, `Git`, `Markdown`, `Python`
  - Overview of some rudimentary syntax for a variety of languages. While this is currently an xlsx file, I hope to transfer to a new medium shortly.

- [Resources](https://github.com/KieraConway/Resources)<br>
  - Language:  `Markdown`, `Python`
  - A group-contributed wiki designed to help BASCO students discover and locate tutorials, ultilities, learning platforms, career guidance, and more.

<h4><b>Completed</b></h4>

- [USLOSS](https://github.com/KieraConway/USLOSS)<br>
  - Language: `C`
  - USLOSS (Unix Software Library for Operating System Simulation) is used to simulate the basic hardware features of a hypothetical computer system. This project includes experimentation with a variety of low-level concepts, including process creation and termination, CPU scheduling, process synchronization and communication via messages and interrupt handlers, inter-process communication primitives, process-control functions, device drivers, and more.
